# SVHN_pred
This is the repo for storing my project that I finished in the course "Getting started with TensorFlow 2" from coursera.
# Problem Definition
Given a 32x32 image from SVHN dataset, predict the number shown in the image from 1 to 10.
# Methods
I used both MLP and CNN approach.
# Results
Achieved a 59% test accuracy with 600k trainable parameters using MLP
Achieved a 84% test accuracy with 50k trainable parameters using CNN
